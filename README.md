# Three-Subnets-with-DHCP

## Contextualization
I connected two networks with three subnets and two routers. For PCs, I used a DHCP server to assign IPs, and switches as bridges.

## Devices:
- 1 – Crossover Cable
- 8 - Straight-Through Cable
- 4 – PCs
- 2 - Switchs(2960-24TT)
- 2 - Routers(1941)
- 2 - DHCP Servers
